= Fulcro RAD Demo

This is a demo repository for Fulcro RAD. It includes a shared source directory of files that would be
common to any project, and then separate source directories that have specific files that would be
needed to work with specific back-end technologies (currently SQL and Datomic).

== Building the SPA

You must compile the CLJS source to run the client. If you want to be
able to edit it, just start a shadow-cljs watch:

[source, bash]
-----
$ yarn
$ shadow-cljs watch example
-----

== Running an SQL-based Sever

The example code should work with most SQL databases, and the data source
is configured in the `defaults.edn` config file in the sql source
directory. See the HikariCP connection pool documentation.

The SQL example has a custom `development` namespace in the `src/sql` source
folder, along with components needed to run that server.

You can start the server-side version for SQL using the deps aliases that
set up the proper classpath:

[source, bash]
-----
$ clj -A:dev:sql
user=> (require 'development)
user=> (development/go)
-----
